Define the following:

array of words
array of valid letters
array of guesses used so far = [];
var win = 0
var loss = 0
var remaining guesses = 10
var wordchoice;
var wordonpage = [];

functions:

initialize
	chooses a word from the array of words
	empties guesses so far.
	select random word from words array
	set remaining guesses to 10
	prints remaining guesses
	print wins
	print losses
	write underscores with forloop
		get length of wordchoice
		push _ into wordonpage for each instance
		print wordonpage

onkeyup
	check if keyinput is a valid letter (needs to be true)
	check if keyinput is not in guesses so far (needs to be true)
	
		for loop (through length of wordonpage)
			if keyinput = letter at position (i)
				then replace that underscore with letter
		
		add keyup to guessesUsed
		print guessesUsed on page
		remaining guesses -1
		print remaining guesses on page
		
	
		after the for loop is over,
		if indexof_ is -1
			add 1 to win
			initialize

		if remaining guesses = 0
			add 1 to lose
			initialize
